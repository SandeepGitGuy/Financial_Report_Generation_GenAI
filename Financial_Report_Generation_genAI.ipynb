      "\n",
      "- **Returns:** The portfolio has achieved a 15% Year-To-Date (YTD) return, which means it has grown by 15% since the beginning of the year. Over the past three years, it has maintained a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 12%, indicating consistent growth over this period.\n",

      "- **Asset Allocation:** The portfolio is composed of 70% Equity, 20% Fixed Income, and 10% Alternatives. Think of this like a meal where the main course is equity, providing the bulk of the growth potential, while fixed income and alternatives act as side dishes, offering stability and diversification.\n",

      "3. **Risk and Volatility:** The portfolio's volatility is 18%, which is expected given the high equity allocation. The Sharpe Ratio of 1.2 suggests that the returns are reasonable for the level of risk taken. It's important to remain comfortable with this level of fluctuation, as it aligns with your high-risk tolerance.\n",
